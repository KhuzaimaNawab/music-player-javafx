# Music Player

This is a simple music player application built on JavaFX that allows users to play music files from their local machine. The application is implemented using a linked list data structure to manage the list of available music files.
#Installation

To run the application, follow these steps:

   1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   2. Make sure you have JavaFX installed on your machine. If not, you can download it from here.
   3. Add music files to the 'music' folder located in the project directory.
   4. Note: It is important to add music files to this folder, otherwise the application will not run any music.
   5. Build the application using the provided build tool or IDE.
   6. Run the application.

# Usage

Once the application is running, users can add or remove music files from the linked list by using the 'Add' and 'Remove' buttons. The 'Play' button will play the selected music file, and the 'Stop' button will stop the playback.

Users can also navigate through the linked list using the 'Previous' and 'Next' buttons to play other music files in the list.
